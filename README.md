## Overview





- I increased my knowledge of API's and get and post server calls through building this newsletter app with the Mail Chimp API.

- Challenge overview
- Some of my biggest challenges with this project was having the rendered value display success or failure with a if statement to inform the user if they have been successfully added to the newsletter. And properly setting up the public file so the app will be styled correctly with the CSS design and not just plain HTML. But through this project I hit road blocks but with the help of Youtube, Stackflow and just looking over my work the project was completed.
